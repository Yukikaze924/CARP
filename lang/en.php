We firmly believe that as humans' closest companions and pets, cats and dogs should be treated with dignity, respect, and appropriate care. Our mission is to advocate for better living conditions for cats and dogs through education, advocacy, and practical action, and to promote society's attention and protection of animal rights",
    '2ndintro' => "Our core belief is that every companion animal deserves basic rights and welfare. We are committed to advocating for stricter animal protection laws by legislative bodies to ensure that companion animals are not abused, harmed, or abandoned. We advocate for the establishment of more comprehensive adoption institutions and processes to reduce the number of stray animals and encourage people to choose adoption over purchasing companion animals.",
